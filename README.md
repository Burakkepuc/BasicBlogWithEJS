It was a course challange for me, I tried to solve as much as by myself.  
I gained confidence about **HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,EJS,EXPRESS.JS,NODE.JS,LODASH LIBRARY ETC..**  

There is some kind of images about images that shows last version of my blog template.  
It is interactive admin panel blog with EJS. It enables us to create blogpost with "/compose" extension.
